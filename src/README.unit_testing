# To run all CLM unit tests on caldera, run the following command:
#
# Note that, on yellowstone/caldera, this requires 'module load all-python-libs'
#
# The creation of a temporary directory ensures that you are doing a completely
# clean build of the unit tests. (The use of the --clean flag to run_tests.py
# cleans most, but not all of the files created by the unit test build.) For
# rerunning the tests after an incremental change, you can instead use an
# existing build directory.
